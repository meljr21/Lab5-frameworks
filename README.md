The project used three key technologies: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.

Bootstrap
Bootstrap was used for responsive layouts, pre-styled components, and utility classes. It allowed for rapid prototyping but had limitations in customization without overriding CSS.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS provided utility-first styling, custom theme configuration, and responsive design. It offered excellent customization and reduced bundle size with PurgeCSS, but had a learning curve due to verbose class lists.

React
React was used for state management, component-based architecture, and conditional rendering. It provided a clean separation of concerns, reactive updates, and an intuitive JSX syntax.

The project showed that:

- Bootstrap is great for quick marketing sites
- Tailwind CSS is ideal for design systems and precise styling control
- React is perfect for building interactive UIs
- The best combination is Tailwind CSS + React for maximum flexibility and clean architecture

Each technology has its strengths, and they complement each other well in frontend development.
